# CartLife
Source code to CartLife, by Richard Hofmeier.

About: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cart_Life

Cart Life is a simulation video game developed by Richard Hofmeier using Adventure Game Studio for Microsoft Windows released in May 2011. The game was added to Steam in March 2013 but later removed when Hofmeier released the full source code for free. The game is designed on a pixel-grid in grayscale, with minimal detail, to better allow the player to deduct the mood of each of the three vendor characters.

In Cart Life the player controls one of three street vendors, and attempts to run their shop whilst looking after their health, interests, and families.

The game was received well by critics, with particular praise for the relatable characters, though some critics criticised technical issues. In 2013 Cart Life won the Independent Games Festival Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Nuovo Award, and Excellence in Narrative award.

You will need [Adventure Game Studio](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) to edit and compile the source.

## Binaries / Game Downloads

Developer-grade releases will be available on the releases page:
https://github.com/tag2015/cartlife/releases

The old (2017 release) is still available on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cartlife/

## Current Work-In-Progress

This was originally written in AGS 3.2.1; it compiles and runs now in AGS 3.6.0.

The current task is to refactor the code with no changes to the gameplay.
Considering the size of the source, this will take some time.

Then we can focus on fixing long-standing bugs and maybe add new features.

## Contributing

There are quite a few bugs people have discovered in CartLife; you are invited to document these in detail, and/or do anything towards solving them.  Open an "issue" here on GitHub.  There are some things referenced in forums on Steam, etc., which may be a useful place to start: https://github.com/gondur/cartlife_src/issues/2

The code is quite messy and needs lots of refactoring, and even just formatting to be readable; as RH notes in the code:
```
// It's clear that, at the time of making this game and writing all of this mind-cancer-inducing code, I was
// new to scripting and was only guessing at how to make things work. What takes cart life hundreds of thousands
// of lines of scripting could be done in a few dozen by a more astute author. But, despite the immeasurable shame
// I feel when I glance back over this shit, I remember that I only learned what I know through looking at the
// attempts made by other authors. If they hadn't granted me the chance to peek under the hoods of their creations,
// I could never have even started to forge my own. It's my dearest hope that any of this is of use to someone.
// BEST OF LUCK, PIONEER!
// -Richard
```

I am following something akin to the PSR-2 standard (as close as practicable in this language) as a style guide and standard to follow when going through this code. http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/
